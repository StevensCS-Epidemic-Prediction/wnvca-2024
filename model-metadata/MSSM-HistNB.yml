data_inputs: Monthly WNV Human Case Counts by County
methods: Negative binomial distributions of historical monthly cases (2006-2023). Final distribution is weighted mixture of county and state-wide distributions.
methods_long: Weighted combinations of county and state negative binomial distributions were tested using Leave-One-Year-Out analysis to determine which combination performs best historically by month. The best-performing weights by month were used to generate mixed distributions for each county-month in 2024. All analysis was performed in R v4.3.2.
