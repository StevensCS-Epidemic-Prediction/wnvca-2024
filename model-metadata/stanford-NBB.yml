methods_long: "A negative binomial distribution was fit to the case data of all years for each county and month. In cases where the fit was not successful, a Poisson distribution was used instead. For county-month combinations with zero observed cases in all years, a Poisson distribution with a small nonzero mean was used. Note that this model differs from the CDPH negative binomial baseline model, as it does not explicitly use the previous year cases as a covariate, and a separate distribution is fit to each county-month combination."
